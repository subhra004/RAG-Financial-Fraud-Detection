# RAG-Financial-Fraud-Detection
• Developed a financial fraud detection system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to analyze financial statements, detect anomalies, and recognize fraudulent patterns.
• Implemented text preprocessing with NLTK, Regex, and Pandas, leveraging Hugging Face Transformers for
fraud detection through advanced NLP techniques
• Utilized Python-based data processing with NumPy and Pandas, ensuring efficient handling of financial datasets
for anomaly detection.
• Executed and tested the model in Google Colab, integrating pretrained AI models and retrieval mechanisms to
enhance fraud detection accuracy.
